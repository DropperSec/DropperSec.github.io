This page is to display the future articles and projects I have planned. I hope to use this as a roadmap for what topic I want to write about next.


So far my only blog post is the one displaying how to capture a Wi-Fi hash and crack it to gain access to Wi-Fi networks. Some of the other articles that are in the works and will be up shortly after my current semester wraps up.
