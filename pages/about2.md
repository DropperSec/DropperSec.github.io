Hi Iâ€™m a third year computer science student that is highly interested in the field of cyber security and Infosec.

I published this blog in order to create some documentation for skills and workflows that I already have and am currently working on. I hope to use this blog as a way to display projects that I am developing and share them to the larger security community.

If you are interested in contacting me, have a question or suggestion about one of my posts please reach out to me over the wire at:
